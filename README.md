# Databel-Customer-Churn-Power-BI-Case-Study

## 📌 Project Introduction
This project analyses customer churn for Databel (telecom) using an interactive Power BI report. The goal is to identify who churns, where churn concentrates, why customers leave, and which levers (pricing, contracts, service operations) most influence retention.

Key KPIs:
- Churn Rate: ~26.86%
- Total Customers: 6,687
- Churned Customers: 1,796


## ✅ Business Problems & Analytical Solutions

### **1. What are the primary drivers of churn at Databel?**
The #1 stated reason is “Competitor made better offer” (~45% of reasoned churn), followed by device-related competition and service attitude issues.

- **Evidence:** Churn Reasons & Categories showing Competitor as the dominant category (~45%), then Attitude (~16%), Dissatisfaction (~11%), Price (~16%), plus Other/No Reason.
  
- **Implication:** Pricing and value positioning versus competitors are the clearest levers. Staff training and CX standards should be a secondary focus.

### **2. Who is most at risk of churn?**

#### **Segmentation:** 
- **Contract Type:** Month-to-Month customers churn the most (often 40–60% across account lengths), while One-Year contracts are much lower (~10–15%) and Two-Year near zero to single digits across many points.
- **Age/Demographics:** Seniors show the highest churn (~38%); Under 30 and Other segments are mid-20s.
- **Account Tenure:** Churn decreases as account length increases (clear downward trend).
- **Plan/Usage:** Customers with Unlimited Data Plan = Yes churn ~32% vs ~16% for No; churn is higher for 5–10 GB users and 10+ GB users than for <5 GB.
- **Implication:** Focus retention on month-to-month, new/early-tenure, senior cohorts and heavy/“unlimited” users with targeted offers and service outreach.
